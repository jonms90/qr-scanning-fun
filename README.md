# QR Scanning Fun
A sample repository for testing SonarCloud and learning about QR codes at the same time.

Do not use this code for working with QR codes.
Instead use [QRCoder by Raffael Herrmann](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder): The library that was the inspiration for this sample repository.
